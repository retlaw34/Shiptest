changes:
  - tweak: The NT 'Boarder' ARG now loads standard P-16 magazines, rather than the
      M-90gl toploaders.
  - balance: Standardizes pellet projectiles to lose 10% damage of both types per
      tile across the board. Improvised pellets no longer have a hardcapped 1-8 tile
      range.
  - balance: Less-lethal rounds now do 50% more stamina than the force of their lethal
      counterparts, with 25% the normal force and double the negative AP. If the round
      had positive or zero AP, it was subtracted by 20.
  - balance: Shotgun slugs do 40 damage, down from 60, but have zero AP, rather than
      -10. FRAG-12 and meteor slugs have had their damage adjusted to reflect their
      relative force.
  - balance: Surplus rifle fire_delay has been cut to 1 second from 3.
  - balance: Any DMR, match, or sniper round now travels slightly faster than other
      bullets. Shotgun slugs and pellets now travel slightly slower than other bullets.
  - balance: Match rounds have had their AP slightly increased.
  - bugfix: Fixed WT-550 magazines not displaying properly.
  - spellcheck: Went over (almost) every single ballistic description, including the
      guns themselves, magazines, ballistic casings, and speed loaders/stripper clips
      to not only have better consistency and readability, but also be more clear
      on the general effectiveness of each caliber.
  - spellcheck: Assualt is gone.
  - code_imp: Repaths/renames most ballistic ammo pathing to maintain consistency
      or take advantage of inherits, when possible.
